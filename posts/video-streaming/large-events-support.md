## Overview
Large video streaming events, such as Live streaming a popular football match, or making available a very much awaited on-demand series, require additional due diligence and planning to ensure a successful event. 

## Capacity planning
The default [quotas of CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html) allow you to peak your traffic to 150 Gbps and 250,000 requests per second (RPS). This represents around 38 thousand simultaneous viewers at 4MB average bitrate. If you have a events that require more capacity, open a ticket to AWS Support to raise those limits. If the required raise hit a hard limit based on the capacity of the existing infrastructure, you can work the AWS Account team to build the required capacity. However, this exercise usually needs to happen at least 6 months before the actual large streaming event.

## Media Event Management
[AWS Elemental Media Event Management](https://aws.amazon.com/media-services/resources/mem/) (MEM) is a support program designed to improve the operational reliability of your business-critical video events. MEM applies a structured process specifically designed for the unique operational requirements of video events, such as the broadcast of a marquee sports event or the launch of a new online video service, that use AWS Media Services or AWS Elemental Appliances and Software.

Each MEM engagement consists of four phases: an initial Planning phase, a Preparation and Testing phase in the weeks leading to the event, Event Support on the day of your event, and a Retrospective summary after the event is completed. An Event Delivery Manager and a Media Enterprise Account Engineer from the AWS Elemental Customer Success team works with you throughout the engagement. The cost and duration varies depending on the size of your event and the complexity of your workload, and typical engagements last between 10 and 18 weeks.
